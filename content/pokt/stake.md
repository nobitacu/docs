description: POKT can only be staked on a node that is relaying RPC requests. You can run a node yourself, pay someone to run a node for you, or join a staking pool.

There is no many-to-one delegation in Pocket Network. You cannot simply stake POKT from your wallet and then forget about it. A POKT account must be staked on a node that is relaying RPC requests. However, if you do not have the skills to run a node yourself, you still have options.

## Run Your Own Node

Running your own node is an option if you possess both of the following:

* The DevOps skills to run your own node
* More than 15,000 POKT to meet the minimum node stake

Read our tutorial on [how to get started running your node](/node/tutorials/zero-to-node/).

## Pay Someone to Run Your Node or Join a Staking Pool

If you don't possess the skills to run your own node, but you do have more than 15,000 POKT for the minimum node stake, you can pay someone else to run your node(s). If you possess neither the skills nor more than the 15,000 POKT minimum node stake, you can join a staking pool. Details regarding fees for their services can be found by joining their server, channel, or website. Like the third-party node runners, staking pools are also entirely custodial, so be sure to do your due diligence.

You can view the list of node runners & staking pools [here](https://forum.pokt.network/t/overview-of-staking-pooling-services/2437/1).
